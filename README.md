## What is this
A simple virtual assistant with voice command.

## Why did I?
I was studying about voice commands with python and I did it just for testing.

## How to use
```
pip install -r scripts\requirements.txt
```

Just say one of the commands and the virtual assistant will respond, as it was just a simple test, I just put the command "Hello" and "What's your name?"

PS: If you are going to speak in English, remove the **`lang`** attribute on line 49.
